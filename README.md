# aidR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of aidR is to collect together a set of R functions that I
otherwise keep on recreating in most projects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of aidR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ryanraaum/aidR")
```

## Usage

There are a few different categories of functions in the package, listed
below.

### Dealing with missing data of various sorts

``` r
library(aidR)

# this_exists(NULL)
```
